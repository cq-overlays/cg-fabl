This is a NodeCG graphics bundle, make sure you have a working NodeCG installation.
- This graphics bundle is controlled with [`cq-overlays/dashboard`](https://github.com/cq-overlays/dashboard).
- This is a custom graphics bundle that I was commissioned for. If you'd like to commission your own, please see my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/leptoflare) page.

## Installation
1. Find the version you're looking for on the releases page, and download `cg-offthedial.zip`.
1. Unzip the file and drag the folder into the `bundles/` subdirectory of your NodeCG installation.

## Running locally

1. `npm run watch` will build the bundle for NodeCG and watch for changes.
1. To build for production:
